# Overview

Welcome to **AlchemyGame** — a fast, satisfying discovery game where you start with just four basic elements and build an entire world by combining them.

There are no tutorials, no hand-holding, and no "correct path".
Just pure experimentation: try ideas, test logic, and unlock surprises.

- Some combinations will feel obvious.
- Some will feel ridiculous.
- And some will unlock things you didn't even know the game could do.

If you enjoy games like Little Alchemy, crafting systems, or puzzle discovery — this is for you.

## How to Play

### 🧩 Combine elements

- Drag an element onto another element to combine them.
- If the combination makes sense, you'll create something new.
- Some reactions can produce multiple results.
- Some elements are dead-ends

### 🔍 Explore and expand

- Every new element you discover becomes part of your growing toolbox.
- Use newly unlocked elements to discover even more.

### ✨ Unlock hidden features

- Some elements don't just expand the list — they can unlock new mechanics and features in the game.
- You'll know when it happens.

## Controls

### Mouse / Touch

- Drag elements to move them around.
- Drop one element onto another to combine them.
- Drag an element back into the palette to delete it and clear space.

### Keyboard (Desktop)

- Press any key to start filtering elements by typing their name.
- This makes it easy to quickly find what you already discovered.

## Tips

- Think in chains: one discovery often leads to several more.
- Try mixing "living" things with "materials" and "tools".
- When stuck, go back to basics and combine new things with the original four elements.

## Goal

There is no final boss. No ending screen. The goal is simple:

**Keep discovering. Keep experimenting. Keep building.**
